Travelling Salesman Problem Using Genetic Algorithm
Using a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution to the traveling salesman problem
(TSP).

Problem Statement:
“Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of
cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city
and returns to the origin city”.

Genetic Algorithm:
Genetic algorithm is started with a set of solutions
(represented by chromosomes) called population. Solutions
from one population are taken and used to form a new
population . The new population will be better than the old 
one.Solutions which are selected to form new solutions 
(offspring) are selected according to their fitness, the more 
suitable they are the more chances they have to reproduce. 

This is repeated until some condition for example number of 
populations or improvement of the best solution is satisfied.
Genetic Algorithm is a paradigm that has proved to be a unique
approach for solving various mathematical problems which
other gradient type of mathematical optimizers have failed to
reach Ant colony optimization has been applied successfully to a
large number of difficult combinatorial optimization problems.



Conclusion :

Various crossover operators have been presented for TSP with 
different applications by using Genetic Algorithm. The traveling 
salesman problem (TSP) has commanded much attention from 
mathematicians and computer scientists specifically because it is 
so easy to describe and so difficult to solve. The problem can 
simply be stated as: if a traveling salesman wishes to visit exactly 
once each of a list of m cities (where the cost of traveling from 
city i to city j is c ij ) and then return to the home city, what is the 
least costly route the traveling salesman can take?
